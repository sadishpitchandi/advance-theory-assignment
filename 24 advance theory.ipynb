    "3. Circular importing, such as when two modules import each other, can lead to dependencies and bugs that aren't visible. How can you go about creating a program that avoids mutual importing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in MOD1.py file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say MOD2.PY file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an import error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because when we import F2() function from module MOD2.py, then this will execute MOD2.py file. And in MOD2.py file there is an another statement of importing MOD1.py module.\n",

In that case it will return the module in which we are working on.
